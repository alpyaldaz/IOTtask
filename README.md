🌱 Home Plant Care Assistant - Business Context

🌍 Project Overview

The Home Plant Care Assistant is a simple yet practical IoT solution designed for plant owners who want to ensure their plants are thriving without constantly checking soil moisture levels. This project utilizes a simulated IoT device to monitor soil moisture and sends real-time data to a cloud-based platform, allowing users to know exactly when their plants need watering. The device alerts users when the moisture levels fall below a defined threshold, ensuring that plants receive water only when needed, thus preventing under-watering or over-watering.

🚩 Problem Statement

Maintaining healthy plants at home can be challenging for many people, especially for those with busy schedules or limited gardening experience. Over-watering and under-watering are common issues that affect plant health and growth. With this project, plant owners can be assured that their plants will receive the optimal amount of water without requiring constant monitoring.

💡 Solution

The Home Plant Care Assistant offers a cloud-connected soil moisture monitoring solution that notifies users when their plant’s soil is dry and needs watering. The IoT device, either real or simulated, checks moisture levels periodically and sends the data to a cloud storage system, where it can be accessed and analyzed in real-time. The backend then processes this data, allowing users to view the current soil status through a simple REST API. Additionally, alerts can be generated when moisture levels fall below a specific threshold, ensuring users are notified in time to keep their plants healthy.

🔑 Key Features

*Real-Time Soil Monitoring 🌡️: Regular monitoring of soil moisture levels ensures plants receive adequate water.

*Cloud Storage ☁️: All moisture readings are stored in the cloud, making it possible to track moisture trends and provide historical insights.

*REST API for Data Access 🔗: Users can access moisture data via a simple API, allowing for easy integration with other applications or devices.

*User Alerts 📲: Customizable alerts notify users when soil moisture is low, helping to avoid plant dehydration.

🎯 Target Users

1-Plant Owners 🪴 who want to maintain their plants’ health but don’t have the time to monitor them constantly.

2-Garden Enthusiasts 🌿 looking to optimize their indoor plant care routines.

3-Developers 👩‍💻 interested in exploring IoT and cloud integration for smart home applications.
